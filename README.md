#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves using structured methodologies, best practices, and programming techniques to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions.
Below are importance of software engineering:
 reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
 efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.




Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity – The shift from simple programs to large, complex systems led to structured programming (e.g., modular design, object-oriented programming) to improve maintainability and scalability.

Mastering Process – The introduction of software development methodologies (e.g., Waterfall, Agile) standardized workflows, improving project management, collaboration, and efficiency.

Mastering Machine – Advances in hardware and low-level programming (e.g., assembly language, compilers) enabled optimized software that fully leveraged machine capabilities, enhancing performance and automation.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Approach:
Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step process where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing development and testing to happen in short cycles called sprints.

Changes and Flexibility:
Waterfall is rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once development begins. Agile embraces change, allowing continuous improvements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Testing and Feedback:
In Waterfall, testing is done only after the entire software is built, which can lead to discovering major issues late in the process. Agile incorporates continuous testing and frequent user feedback, reducing the risk of late-stage failures.

Client Involvement:
Waterfall has minimal client involvement after the initial requirement gathering. Agile keeps clients engaged throughout the development process, ensuring the final product meets their expectations.

Best Use Cases:
Waterfall works best for projects with well-defined, fixed requirements, such as government systems or banking software. Agile is ideal for dynamic projects like mobile apps or web platforms, where frequent updates and user-driven changes are required.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, follows best coding practices, and collaborates on software architecture.
Quality Assurance Engineer (QA) – Tests software for bugs, ensures functionality, and improves quality via automation/manual testing.
Project Manager (PM) – Oversees project scope, manages resources, ensures deadlines are met, and liaises between teams and stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. (Examples: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm)
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Track changes, enable collaboration, and maintain code history. (Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.

Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.

Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
 Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining text inputs to optimize AI-generated responses. It enhances accuracy, relevance, and efficiency in AI interactions, especially in NLP models like ChatGPT.
Importance of Prompt Engineering;
Enhances AI Accuracy and Relevance – Well-structured prompts guide AI models to generate precise and meaningful responses, reducing vague or incorrect answers.
Improves Efficiency in AI Interactions – A clear prompt minimizes back-and-forth clarifications, saving time and making interactions more productive.
Optimizes AI for Specific Tasks – Properly designed prompts can tailor AI responses for various applications like content creation, coding, data analysis, and customer support.
Enables Better Control Over AI Output – By refining prompts, users can adjust AI tone, depth, and focus, ensuring responses align with their needs.
Maximizes AI Potential Across Industries – From healthcare to finance, effective prompt engineering enhances AI-driven decision-making, automation, and problem-solving.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about history."

Improved Prompt:
"Describe the causes and consequences of the French Revolution, focusing on its impact on society and government."

Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective?
More Specific – Instead of a broad request about "history," it narrows the focus to the French Revolution.
Clearly Defined Scope – It specifies key aspects (causes, consequences, impact on society and government).
Concise and Direct – Eliminates ambiguity, ensuring a well-structured and relevant response.

This improved prompt ensures a more focused and informative answer, avoiding unnecessary generalizations.
